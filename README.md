## Gamitee hiring take home task

Write a script that when added to a website will scrape the page structure (DOM) and will
show the DOM as nested boxes with different color for each element type and the element
type as a text in the box at the bottom of the page. (For example: letâ€™s assume that we have
a page with 2 divs, one contains a span and one contains a ul with 3 li, you will have a big
box with the text body inside 2 boxes with the text div. One of those contain another box with
the text span and one with a box ul and inside it 3 boxes with the text li)

When hovering on the boxes in your addition to the page, the actual element that we are
referring to will be highlighted. (you can change the background color of the referenced
element to one with some opacity to make it simple).

## Bonus

Add support for dragging and dropping the elements in your component. Dragging an
element around should reorder the referred element in the original DOM itself.
